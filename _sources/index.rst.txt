Cechmate

This library provides easy to use constructors for custom filtrations. It is currently designed to produce filtrations suitable for use with Phat. Phat currently provides a clean interface for persistence reduction algorithms for boundary matrices. This tool helps bridge the gap between data and boundary matrices.
Currently, we support construction of Alpha and Rips filtrations, with more on the way.

If you have a particular filtration you would like implemented, please feel free to reach out and we can work on helping with implementation and integration, so others can use it.

Setup
=======
